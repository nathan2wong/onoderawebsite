                    <h2><center>How to get a letter of recommendation</center></h2>
                </header>
                <p>There is a Word document at the bottom with specific information on what to write for a college letter of recommendation. For summer programs, please do not give me a folder or a transcript. I want a "blurb" about the program, why you
                    chose it, what you want to do in the future, your current hobbies/experience related to program, etc. This writing should be given to me hard copy along with information on how the recommendation will be sent and when (email sent to
                    me; send PDF letter; etc). Use the mia_onodera@fuhsd.org address for emails and also provide me with your non-Schoolloop address.
<br><br>
                    <strong>When to ask Ms. O for a letter of rec</strong> Traditionally, letters of recommendations for college admittance are written by teachers a student has his/her junior year. Often Ms. O writes letters for colleges when a student
                    is a TA, athlete, or tutor (a personal connection outside of sophomore chemistry). However, some universities have been specifically asking for two letters from science/math teachers. If this is the case, then it is o.k. for a sophomore
                    teacher to write a letter. If a student feels he/she does not have a good option for a junior/senior teacher to write a letter (student has a difficult year or the teachers have too many letters to write, etc.), this would be another
                    time that a sophomore teacher would be the right choice. More and more sophomores are electing to apply for summer internships and programs that require letters of recommendations. Ms. O asks that students only ask for a letter once
                    in an academic year. She does not mind writing for more than one program in one sitting but finds it a burden for the same student to ask for something two, three, four times unless it is a follow up letter. Letters of recommendation
                    for volunteer work are o.k. at any time. However, again, please come prepared. Ask me in person and have the paperwork ready.
<br><br>
                    <strong>A list of what to do for letters of rec</strong> Instead of the no-nos...try the YES-YESsss: <br>1. Ask the teacher in person for a letter of rec <br>2. Send an email before and/or after about the letter of rec so the teacher has a
                    reminder and more details <br>3. Come prepared- know what type of letter, how it will be delivered, what specifics are to be addressed, due dates, addressed and stamped envelopes if required, etc. <br>4. If the teacher gives you guidelines
                    for the letters (writing about yourself, putting a file together including transcripts, or whatever the requests are), follow them <br>5. Give the teacher plenty of time to write the letter of rec; politely check up if the due date is
                    near and the letter has not been completed <br>6. Thank the teacher- large monetary gifts are not appropriate; a personal thank you; a card; an update on the status of what you applied for-- just a sense that the time the teacher took
                    is appreciated
<br><br>
                    <strong>A list of what not to do for letters of rec</strong> It is not in a teacher's job description to write letters of recommendation. Most teachers are more than willing to write letters in support of students. However, here is
                    a list of NO-NOs that I have experienced at Monta Vista: <br>1. Your parent should not be asking for a letter of rec for you <br>2. You should not add a teacher to Naviance without speaking with the teacher first <br>3. You should not ask every
                    teacher for a letter and then go back and say "never mind" if you have more than enough teachers <br>4. You should not ask for a letter from many teachers and then not send some letters because you have enough <br>5. You should not ask a teacher
                    for a letter of rec at the last minute (I've had several ask for a letter for the next day or over the weekend) nor ask for a letter without knowing exactly what the letter is supposed to address and other details &nbsp; Find the document
